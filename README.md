By default, when holding left or right, the character starts to walk
and slowly ramps up in speed if the button keeps being pressed.

This patch makes the character stay at walking speed,
unless the `[A]` button is held, which immediately gives you running speed.

## Download
The latest release can be found on the
[releases page](https://github.com/lightbulb-sun/coolspot-run/releases).
Patch the original ROM with one of the `.bsdiff`, `.ips` or `.bps` files
to create the hack.
